    "Simple Text Analysis and Word Cloud Generator  \n",
    "**Objective:** Build a Python program that analyzes a text file and generates a word cloud based on word frequency.  \n",
    "##### Steps to Get Started:\n",
    "1. Read a Text File:\n",
    "    * Use Python's file I/O (open(), read(), etc.) to load a text file. You can use any book or article from Project Gutenberg as your dataset.\n",
    "2. Preprocess the Text:\n",
    "    * Clean the text by converting it to lowercase, removing punctuation, and splitting it into words.\n",
    "    * Use sets and dictionaries to filter out common stop words (like \"the\", \"is\", etc.).\n",
    "3. Count Word Frequency:\n",
    "    * Use a dictionary to store the frequency of each word. Iterate over the cleaned text and update word counts.\n",
    "    * Apply loops, conditionals, and basic functions to count word occurrences and filter out less frequent words.\n",
    "4. Generate a Word Cloud:\n",
    "    * Use the wordcloud Python library to create a visual word cloud from the most frequent words in your text.\n",
    "    * You can also create a bar chart to show the top 10 most frequent words using matplotlib.\n",
    "5. Enhancements:\n",
    "    * Allow the user to choose a text file, stopword list, or minimum word frequency via user input.\n",
    "    * Include error handling for cases like file not found or empty text files.\n",
    "      \n",
    "##### Tools & Libraries to Use:\n",
    "* File I/O: To read and process the text file.\n",
    "* String manipulation: For cleaning and tokenizing text.\n",
    "* Matplotlib/Wordcloud: For visualizations (word cloud and bar chart)."
